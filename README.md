## i. Prerequisites

### 1. Java Core

It is critical that you understand the programming language of the framework you are trying to specialise in.
Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework therefore you must know Java beforehand.

For Java, it is important to understand many concepts. This includes: OOP, Interfaces, Variables, Classes, Loops, Inheritance, Datastructures etc.

<br>

### 2. Databases

A full stack developer must work with databases. A database in a web application is a way of storing and organise the data for your project. There are many types of databases to learn, but here are a few popular ones: SQL, MySQL, NoSQL and MongoDB.

One must be familiar with ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools such as Spring Data JPA or Hibernate. You must also be familiar with SQL commands and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

<br>

### 3. Build Tools

Build tools are commonly known as programs that automate the process of building an executable application from source code. This building process includes activities like compiling, linking and packaging the code into an executable form.
Following is the list of Open source Java Builds: Apache Maven, Ant with ivy, Gradle and SBT.

Maven’s scalability and extensibility make it an attractive choice for small development teams who need automated builds but don’t have a lot of resources allocated toward software engineering overhead.

<br>

## ii. Extra

### 1. Git

Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

Git can be used in the Terminal therefore it is ideal to be familiar with Linux/UNIX bash commands.

### 2. Logging / Documentation

Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. Logging is important for software developing, debugging, and running. If you don't have any logging record and your program crashes, there are very few chances that you detect the cause of the problem. 

The most popular java logging frameworks are Log4j2 and Logback. They have a predecessor in Log4j. SLF4J is a logging facade that provides a common interface for different logging frameworks.

Swagger UI, a part of Swagger, is an open source tool that generates a web page that documents the APIs generated by the Swagger specification. This UI presentation of the APIs is user friendly and easy to understand, with all logic complexity kept behind the screen.
